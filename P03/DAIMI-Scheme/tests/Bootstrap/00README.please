The program in the file "cmp.scm" calls the compiler to compile "cmp.scm".

The dsa files in this directory were obtained by

(1) compiling "cmp.scm" and renaming the result ("cmp.dsa-renamed");

(2) running "cmp.scm" and obtaining a compiled file "cmp.dsa",

or equivalently by

(1) compiling "cmp.scm" and obtaining a compiled file "cmp.dsa";

(2) running "cmp.dsa" (and, once it has started to run, renaming
    it to "cmp.dsa-renamed"), and obtaining a compiled file "cmp.dsa".

The files "cmp.dsa" and "cmp.dsa-renamed" are identical,
which demonstrates that the DAIMI-Scheme compiler can compile itself.

Indeed, running "cmp.scm" has the effect of compiling it.  What the
experiment above shows is that compiling this file (with the source
DAIMI-Scheme compiler) and running it (thereby compiling this file with
the compiled DAIMI-Scheme compiler) yield the same result.

(A more useful version of "cmp.scm" would read the name of the file to
compile instead of only compiling "cmp.scm".)

----------

The file "cmp-boxed.scm" has been obtained by running the front-end
compiler on "cmp.scm".

The file "cmp-boxed.scm" has been modified by replacing its last line,
    (dump "tests/Bootstrap/cmp.scm")
by
    (dump "tests/Bootstrap/cmp-boxed.scm")

The file "cmp-boxed.scm" has been loaded and ran, and a compiled file
"cmp-boxed.dsa" has been obtained.

The file "cmp-boxed.dsa" has been ran (and, once this run has started, it
has been renamed "cmp-boxed.dsa-renamed").  The result of this run is a
new file "cmp-boxed.dsa".

The files "cmp-boxed.dsa" and "cmp-boxed.dsa-renamed" are identical,
which demonstrates that the DAIMI-Scheme compiler can compile itself.

----------

How to bootstrap the DAIMI-Scheme compiler with another compiler than the
DAIMI-Scheme compiler will be covered in a lecture, and summarized in a
lecture note.
