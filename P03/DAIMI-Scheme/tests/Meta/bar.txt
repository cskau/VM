The session in the file "bar.session" should be read as follows:

----------

First, the DAIMI-Scheme compiler and VM are loaded.

----------

The file "bar.scm" contains a DAIMI-Scheme program.

We compile this program with the command dump.
The compiled program is in a file "bar.dsa".

----------

We rename "bar.dsa" into "bar.dsa-renamed".

----------

The file "bar-meta.scm" contains a DAIMI-Scheme program that
(1) loads the DAIMI-Scheme compiler and VM, and
(2) compiles the contents of the file "bar.scm".

We (compile and) run this program with the command run.
The compiled program is in a file "bar.dsa".

----------

We compare the files "bar.dsa" into "bar.dsa-renamed"
and they are identical.

----------

The file "bar-meta-meta.scm" contains a DAIMI-Scheme program that
(1) loads the DAIMI-Scheme compiler and VM, and
(2) compiles the contents of the file "bar-meta.scm".

We compile run this program with the command dump.
The compiled program is in a file "bar-meta-meta.dsa".

----------

We compare the files "bar-meta-meta.dsa" into "bar-meta.dsa"
and they only differ by one string:

In "bar-meta-meta.dsa":
    (load str "tests/Meta/bar-meta.scm" vec 0)

In "bar-meta.dsa":
    (load str "tests/Meta/bar.scm" vec 0)
