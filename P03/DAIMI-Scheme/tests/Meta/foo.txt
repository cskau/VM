The session in the file "foo.session" should be read as follows:

----------

First, the DAIMI-Scheme compiler and VM are loaded.

----------

The file "foo.scm" contains a DAIMI-Scheme program
that yields the answer 42 (in case you wondered).

We (compile and) run this program with the command run,
and we time it.

----------

The file "foo-meta.scm" contains a DAIMI-Scheme program that
(1) loads the DAIMI-Scheme compiler and VM, and
(2) runs the content of the file "foo.scm".

We (compile and) run this program with the command run,
and we time it.

----------

The file "foo-meta-meta.scm" contains a DAIMI-Scheme program that
(1) loads the DAIMI-Scheme compiler and VM, and
(2) runs the content of the file "foo-meta.scm".

We (compile and) run this program with the command run,
and we time it.

----------

The conclusion is that running interpreters on top of other interpreters
is *costly*.  That is a reason why compilers were invented---ie, to
remove interpretive overhead.
