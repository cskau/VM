----------

This release is DAIMI-Scheme-compliant, ie, it can compile itself.
(See "tests/Bootstrap/".)

----------

In case of questions, comments, criticisms, or bug report, please send
an e-mail to <danvy@daimi.au.dk>.

If you are having a problem with this compiler, can you please first
make sure that Petite Chez Scheme runs your source program without error.
If this is the case, please send me an e-mail, including

    - the source program, and

    - the nature of the error (a copy of the Petite Chez Scheme
      session provoking the error would be helpful).

Thank you.	-- Olivier
