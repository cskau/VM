(parse-program p)
where p denotes a program read from a file

(read-file f)
where f denotes a file name


Given the file name of a DAIMI-Scheme program, Procedure parse-program
opens and reads this file (including all the files that can be loaded in
the file), and returns a parsed program, ie, a record with 3 elements:
	- the list of all record definitions
	- the list of all definitions
	- the main expression

A number of things are checked:
	- the absence of circular loads
	- the syntactic validity of the program

----------

Abstract syntax is defined as a bunch of records.
