- corrected DS2S
  in DAIMI-Scheme/lib/vm.scm
  so that it outputs Scheme-compliant vectors

  in compiler.scm
  so that vectors are printed without numeric prefix

- added a read interface to mutable toplevel variables
  in DAIMI-Scheme/lib/2boxer.scm
  so that
    (define a 100)

    (foo a (set! a 200))
  yields 100 instead of 200.
