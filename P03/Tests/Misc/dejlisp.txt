Dejlisp, an interactive interpreter for a subset of Scheme
which is only waiting for you to make it
    - more robust (so that, eg, it checks arities)
    - richer (so that, eg, it treats more predefined functions)
    - meta-circular (so that you can run it on top of itself)

----------

BNF:

   <program> ::= (define <symbol> <expression>)
               | (exit)
               | <expression>

<expression> ::= <integer>
               | <symbol>
               | (quote <pretty much anything you like>)
               | (lambda <symbol> <expression>)
               | (lambda (<symbol>*) <expression>)
               | (if <expression> <expression> <expression>)
               | (<expression> <expression>*)

----------

Predefined functions:

car, cdr, cons, null?, pair?, eqv?, equal?, apply, =, +, -, *
