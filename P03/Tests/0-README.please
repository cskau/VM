% Tests/0-README.please -*- text -*-

This directory contains a host of DAIMI-Scheme programs to test both the
compiler and the VM.  When necessary, each file contains an explanatory
comment.  Otherwise, the name of the file is (supposed to be)
self-explanatory.

1-simple-values/
    Each file contains one Scheme expression which is a value.

2-simple-computations/
    Each file contains one Scheme expression which is a simple
    computation.

3-simple-definitions/
    Each file contains one or more Scheme definitions involving one
    simple computation, and one simple computation.

4-compound-definitions-and-computations/
    Each file contains Scheme definitions involving compound
    computations, and one compound computation.

5-basic-programs/
    Each file contains a basic DAIMI-Scheme program.

6-advanced-programs/
    Each file contains an advanced DAIMI-Scheme program, for instance
    one using call/cc in a nontrivial way.

Bounds/
    This directory contains DAIMI-Scheme assembly programs that access
    aux-vec and env-lex out of bounds. They must all result in an
    error message when run in the vm.

Misc/
    Each file contains some program that is either interactive or has
    implementation-dependant output.

Semantic-bugs/
    Each file contains a DAIMI-Scheme program that behaves anomalously
    at run time, and a comment that explains the anomaly.

Syntactic-bugs/
    Each file contains a DAIMI-Scheme program that behaves anomalously
    at compile time, and a comment that explains the anomaly.
    (This directory is only here to test the front-end of the compiler.)

----------

Since DAIMI-Scheme is deprived of file-removing and file-modifying
capabilities, all of these programs are safe to run, ie, they won't
delete files, rename files, overwrite files, change read / write access,
reformat your hard disk, or read sensitive information and e-mail it to
the tax authorities.

Conversely, your VM will be run from a sandbox, namely the
<dovs@daimi.au.dk> computer account.
